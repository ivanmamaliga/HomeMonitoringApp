# HomeMonitoringApp

The Home Monitoring is helping to manage different area devices in building,
such as bulbs, vents, shades(not implemented) based on current weather
conditions. The weather conditions are provided by OpenWeather API
(www.openweathermap.org)

## Instructions

To run this application you will need an API key from <https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys>. At the time of implementation of this app the OpenWeather API key was free given some conditions.

### Code Louisville Feature Matrix

- [x] Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
- [x] Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
- [x] Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
- [ ] Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
- [x] Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
- [ ] Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
- [x] Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
- [ ] Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file
- [ ] Create 3 or more unit tests for your application
- [ ] Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
- [ ] Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
- [ ] Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
- [ ] Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
